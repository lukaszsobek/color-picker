Color Picker with:
  JavaScript, ES6, React, JSX, Redux, Jest

Test coverage:
  App render 

Note:
  Apart from it being a sample React/Redux app
  there seems to be no need to use Redux in this
  application at all. The outcome would be very
  similar using less code and  would be the
  preferred way of solving the problem.

  I this was part of a larger whole, however, 
  we would be in a totally different situation.
