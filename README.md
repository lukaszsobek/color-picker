### Color Picker with:
  JavaScript, ES6, React, JSX, Redux, Jest

### Test coverage:  
  App render, actions, components

### Note:  
  Apart from it being a sample React/Redux app
  there seems to be no need to use Redux in this
  application at all. The outcome would be very
  similar using less code and  would be the
  preferred way of solving the problem.

  Also there is no need to import through the index
  file of a folder in a small application. 

  If this was part of a larger whole, however, 
  we would be in a totally different situation.
